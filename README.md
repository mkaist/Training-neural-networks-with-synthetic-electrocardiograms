# Domain randomization using synthetic electrocardiograms for training neural networks

This repository contains the relevant part of the code described in Kaisti, Matti, et al. "Domain randomization using synthetic electrocardiograms for training neural networks." Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (2023): 102583, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102583.
The usage is demonstrated in a Jupyter notebook “demo.ipynb”. The yaml files are used as input configuration files.
